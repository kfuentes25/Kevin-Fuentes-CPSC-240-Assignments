;  Prototype of this function:  char * ftoa(double floatnum);

;Background
;  Floating-point numbers in most modern computers are stored in a format known as IEEE754.  For example, a 
;number like 4.1 appears to humans a two decimal digits.  But the machine does not store a 4 and a 1.  The 
;machine holds a binary representation of the number that is somewhat akin to 4.0999999999.  When a float 
;number 4.1 is passed to the function ftoa, the function is actually receiving 4.099999.  This function 
;ftoa will act on the internal numberic representation given to it.  In the example, the machine has no 
;knowlege of 4.1 but does have 4.099999999.  We will see this reflected in the outputs produced by ftoa.

;Prototype of ftoa:  char * ftoa(double x);
;ftoa may be called from C++, C, or X86.

;Terminology:  Consider the floating point number  385.6291.   The group 385 is called the integral part and 
;the group 6291 is called the fractional part.

;About the string length of the returned C-string.  The programmer or user of ftoa should set the length of
;returned C-string by adjusting the constant string_len declared in the Declaration section below.  A small value
;less than say 5 will not produce meaningful values.  The constant should be re-set to meet the needs of the 
;current user.

;No AI was used in the construction of this library function ftoa.  The source files driver.cpp and ftoa.asm are
;formatted for understandability by beginning students of computer science.
